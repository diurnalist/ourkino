A simple movie showtime listing for a highly curated list of locations. Currently supports showtimes for ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Berlin** and ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **Chicago**, because that is where I have resided.

This listing is biased towards independent cinemas. Particularly in Berlin, there was no single site that simply listed what films are playing across the subset of kinos that tend to run indie films.

The UI displays all upcoming shows in time order, regardless of location. The assumption is that you care more about the when than the where. A filter box enables you to filter by cinema or movie title.

## Building

```shell
yarn install && yarn build
```

## Testing

### Testing a single scraper

```shell
# Pass in name of scraper as argument
yarn run test-scraper -- 'gene siskel'
```

## Acknowledgements

For the Berlin listings, this relies heavily on the high-quality listing information assembled and presented by [kinoheld](https://www.kinoheld.de/). For the Chicago listings, it uses the showtime feeds from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/).
